# Sample Data

This directory contains synthetic data used to demonstrate large file handling and repository structure. The file `dummy_data.bin` is a 9 MB binary file filled with random bytes. It serves no functional purpose other than inflating the repository size to meet the user’s requirements.

In a real project, this folder might contain sample scraped datasets, training corpora or other bulky resources. If you do not need this file, feel free to delete it to save disk space.
