# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This extension, *Universal Web Scraper*, is designed to help you extract
information from web pages you visit. We respect your privacy and are
committed to protecting any personal information you may share while using
our extension or associated web services.

## Data Collection

The extension operates entirely within your browser and runs only when
you explicitly click the **Scrape Current Page** button. When you
activate the extension:

* The extension accesses the currently active tab to read its HTML and
  extract text, metadata, images, and links. This data is processed
  locally in your browser. No browsing data is collected or transmitted
  until you initiate a scrape.
* We **do not** collect any personal information about you, nor do we
  track or monitor your browsing history. The scraped data is not sent
  to us or stored on any server by default.
* If you choose to use an external AI provider (for example, to request
  a structured summary), the extension will send only the text extracted
  from the page and your request prompt to that provider’s API. The
  request may include an API key you provide. These requests are made
  directly from your browser to the selected provider’s endpoint.

## Data Usage

Your scraped data remains in your local browser session unless you choose
to download it. When using an external provider, the data you send is
used solely to fulfil your request. We do not retain or share this
information.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

* **activeTab** – to access the contents of the current tab when you
  initiate a scrape.
* **scripting** – to execute the content script that performs the
  extraction.
* **downloads** – to allow you to save the extracted data as a file.

These permissions are the minimum required to provide the core
functionality. The extension does not request broad host permissions or
access to other browser data.

## User Control

You can choose whether to initiate a scrape, whether to send data to an
external provider, and whether to download the results. You may remove
the extension at any time via your browser’s extension manager. If you
do not agree with this policy, please refrain from using the extension.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy or wish to report a privacy
concern, please contact the developer through the support page listed on
the extension’s store listing.
